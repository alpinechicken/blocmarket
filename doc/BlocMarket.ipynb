    "\n",

    "The protocol uses a chain of signatures to organize buy and sell orders for these contracts. Orders are accepted if they have a valid signature and the trader's positions satisfiy a collateral check across all possible worst outcomes. To maintain an appropriate record of the order book, trades can only be added, and the validity of any trade can be checked by anyone using public keys provided by each participant.\n",

For example, the lower bound for each market is the highest lower bound for itself of  any sub-market or any previous bound on the same market.
